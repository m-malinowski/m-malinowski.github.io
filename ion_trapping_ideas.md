Collecting good new ideas in trapped-ion quantum computing as I stumble upon them. Do send me anything I missed!

**2022**
- Ions can be moved in 2D just as well as in 1D: https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11888
- Raman gates can be good if you do your numbers carefully: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00744

**2023**
- Laser ablation can be done from behind: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07639
- Good ion loading is not about trap depth, it's about trap volume: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02143
- Traps with SNSPDs may be quite practical after all: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01462.pdf
- It is not that hard to wire up 1000 qubits (my own paper lol): https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12773
- Penning traps might actually make quantum computers: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07672
- Ion traps can be 3D printed: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00595.pdf
- Long ion chains get one more shot, thanks to optical tweezers: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01168.pdf
- Light-induced stray fields can be modelled (sometimes): https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00059.pdf
