For a quick feel of what I'm into - and what priors I'm likely to have - here are some things I believe are true, as of late 2022, in no particular order.

- Institutions
    - The meta-problem behind most problems is that established institutions do not have in-built error correction mechanisms
    - Unless an organisation has strong in-built incentives that reward those who make good decisions, it will make bad decisions
    - Open markets are the best tools we have for making correct decisions.
    - All institutions should be digital-first, with a user interface at most as complex as Spotify. 
    - People should be paid for time spent filling out forms. 
- Life
    - The main point of life is to be happy.
    - Being happy makes us better parents, better partners, better relatives, and better friends. That being said, making your friends and family happy is a good way to increase one's happiness
    - Death fundamentally sucks. There's no way to be comfortable with the idea death - better not think too much about it.
- Climate change
    - Climate change is a nasty nasty problem with no easy solution. I would not like to be in the shoes of decisionmakers here
    - Transitioning to net-zero by 2050 as per Paris agreement would be insanely costly and make the whole world poor and miserable. Prediction: the world will not reach zero by 2050, not even close.
    - Plastic bags are, and always were, the most environmentally-friendly type of bags. Also, plastic bags are, and always were, irrelevant to the climate problem.
    - Society systematically mistakes feel-good eco-looking policies for effective climate policies, causing a lot of climate damage. The biggest single example are the anti-nuclear policies and regulations.
    - Nuclear power is one of the most under-utilised climate solutions. Nuclear energy cost could come down dramatically if regulations were relaxed worldwide. Nuclear waste is not a real problem, but availability of uranium may be.
    - Solar and wind are the cheapest forms of energy only if you maths is dodgy. Their cost will not come down significantly until cheaper energy storage solutions exist.
- Science and society
    - Scientific progress is slowing down.
    - The progress in AI is the most interesting development in science and technology over the recent decade (2012-2022).
    - Scientific progress rate depends on the available tools. Prediction: the most impactful scientific tools of the coming decade (2022-2032) will be enabled by AI.
    - Pretty much everything we know to be true in "soft sciences" comes from randomised trials and natural experiments. Therefore, whenever confronted with uncertainties, large institutions and governments should use this opportunity to conduct a randomised trial. 
- Immigration
    - Removing immigration restrictions would be one of the best policies a rich country could implement, morally and economically.
    - If a working-age immigrant introduces a burden on your economy, you're doing something very wrong with your economy. Rather than kicking the immigrant out, stop that and let them stay.
- Houses
    - UK houses are expensive and tiny. The main reason is market regulation.
    - High housing costs have disastrous knock-on effects on the whole economy, as people can't move to where their work or family is. Thus, massive deregulation would create massive prosperity.
- Economy
    - Baumol's cost disease is real and will continue. Things that were cheap 50 years ago but seem pricy today will be prohibitively expensive in 50 years - so enjoy them while you can.
    - Broadly speaking, lower taxation is better for people. The main reason is not that redistribution is bad, but that that governments are bad at spending money effectively.
    - Corporations are not evil. They are greedy, and that's good. The government's role is to build and maintain markets where competition between greedy parties leads to net societal benefit. Non-greedy institutions are the ones we should worry about.
    - Licences for taxi drivers, realtors and hairdressers are here not to protect the public from unqualified professionals, but to protect the existing businesses from competition.
- Health and medicine
    - While imperfect in its execution, the idea behind "western medicine" is spot on, and one of the key reasons why life today is better than it used to be
    - The doctor shortage problem could be fixed by opening up vastly more spots to study medicine at the university.
    - The world would be much better off if we found ways of making medical trials faster and cheaper.
- Academia
    - Tenued academic positions are much less fun than they seem.
    - Reducing the bureocratic overhead is the highest-leverage way to speed up scientific progress.
    - Increasing PhD salaries 2x while decreasing the number of PhD students 2x would probably be a net win for science and for the economy (in the UK, where grad students earn 16k GBP per year in 2022)
- Education
    - Going to university is fun, but it's not clear to what extent universal higher education makes the world better off. Most of it is probably a zero-sum game.
    - It's very easy to spend more money on education and get nothing in return
    - It's not clear if fancy and expensive schools deliver better education than regular free schools
    - School holiday policy should be: "you can take your kid out of school for however long you wish, whenever you wish". 
- Learning
    - Podcasts are the best way of consuming non-fiction content
    - Solving problems by yourself is the only way to learn maths and physics
    - Spaced repetition is the best way of memorising content
    - Having to teach a topic is a shockingly effective way of learning a topic
    - Schools shouldn't teach kids stuff, instead, they should help them teach themselves
