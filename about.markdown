Welcome! I'm [Maciej](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M4vNyAEAAAAJ&hl=en), and I'm a physicist building a trapped-ion quantum computer at [Oxford Ionics](https://www.oxionics.com/). I live in Didcot, UK with my wife Chiara and my dog Dylan. I did my PhD with [Jonathan Home at ETH Zurich](https://tiqi.ethz.ch/).
